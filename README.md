# Executive Report: Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning

## Executive Summary

Phishing attacks continue to be a significant threat to cybersecurity, with recent incidents, such as the Crowstrike breach, highlighting the urgent need for robust detection mechanisms. This project aims to leverage machine learning to identify phishing URLs effectively. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of URL features and applying various classification models, we seek to improve the accuracy and reliability of phishing detection systems. This report outlines the methodology, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, results, and recommendations for future work.

## Introduction

Phishing is a form of cyber-attack where attackers deceive individuals into providing sensitive information by masquerading as trustworthy entities. The increasing sophistication of phishing techniques necessitates advanced detection methods. This project focuses on using machine learning to develop models that can accurately classify URLs as phishing or legitimate, thereby enhancing cybersecurity measures and protecting users from potential threats.

## Data Overview

The dataset used for this project consists of 32 columns and 11,055 entries, capturing various features of URLs that can indicate phishing activity. To access the dataset, please click on the Kaggle logo located on the page of this report.

### Structure and Basic Statistics

The dataset includes features such as URL length, presence of IP addresses, SSL state, domain registration length, and more. These features are critical in distinguishing between legitimate and phishing URLs.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for model training. This involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Normalizing features ensures that models, especially those based on distance metrics, perform optimally by bringing all values onto a similar scale.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is essential for understanding the dataset's underlying structure and identifying patterns. By visualizing data through various plots, we gain insights that guide feature selection and model development.

### Distribution of URL Labels

The distribution of URL labels shows a higher count of legitimate URLs compared to phishing URLs, highlighting the dataset's imbalance.

### Histograms

Histograms provide a visual summary of the distribution of numerical features. For this project, key features such as URL length, SSL state, and domain registration length were analyzed. These features exhibit distinct patterns that differentiate phishing from legitimate URLs.

### Box Plots

Box plots help identify the spread and outliers in the data. Key features such as URL length and SSL state showed significant differences between legitimate and phishing URLs, emphasizing their importance in model training.

### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots reveal relationships between pairs of numerical features. For instance, the relationship between URL length and domain age can indicate phishing activity, with phishing URLs often having specific characteristics in these features.

### Violin Plots

Violin plots combine the benefits of box plots and density plots, showing the distribution of numerical features for different URL labels. This helps in understanding the variability and density of features across phishing and legitimate URLs.

### Heatmap

The correlation matrix heatmap visualizes the relationships between features. Strong correlations between specific features guide feature selection and engineering, improving model performance.

## Modeling

Multiple machine learning algorithms were selected based on their strengths in classification tasks. Models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Gaussian Naive Bayes were evaluated.

### Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis highlights SSL state, URL anchor, and web traffic as the most significant predictors of phishing activity. This guides the focus on critical features in model development.

### Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall. Below are the results of the model evaluations:

| Model                | Accuracy | AUC  | F1-Score | Precision | Recall |

| Decision Tree        | 0.79     | 0.79 | 0.79     | 0.79      | 0.79   |
| K-Neighbors          | 0.99     | 0.99 | 0.99     | 0.99      | 0.99   |
| SVM                  | 0.90     | 0.90 | 0.90     | 0.90      | 0.90   |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | 0.94     | 0.94 | 0.94     | 0.94      | 0.94   |

### ROC Curve

The ROC curve compares the performance of different models. The Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models demonstrate the highest AUC, indicating their superior ability to distinguish between phishing and legitimate URLs.

### Feed-Forward Neural Network Results

The Feed-Forward Neural Network achieved an AUC of 0.55, indicating moderate performance. Further tuning and data augmentation could enhance its effectiveness.
